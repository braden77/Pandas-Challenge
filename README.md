# Pandas-Challenge

* In this task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend are provided. My responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

* The final report include each of the following:
    1. A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics;
    2. A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.
    3. A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. 
    4. A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
    5. Several tables that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges, School Size and School Type.
    6. The written description of observable trends I find based on the tables.
